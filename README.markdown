This is a project from the 2nd Bachelor. The task was to write a framework for
playing boardgames over a local network, which offers additional chat windows
and some other random things.

Compiling
---------

This framework is written in Java 6, and requires jdom.

Developing games
----------------

There are two examples of games included, who compile if you include our
framework in the classpath. Just figure out the rest yourself.
